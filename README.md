# RubyOnRailsQuizApp
A multiple choice quiz app for presenters to quiz an audience

# Goals

 -  Allow a "presenter" to "broadcast" a multi-choice question to a "room"

 - Allow viewers of a "room" to view the current "question" and to "answer"

 - Allow presenters to view result data in realtime for the current "session"

 - Allow presenters to save "questions" for re-use

 - Allow presenters to view results for previous "sessions"


# Tech Stack and Reasoning

This project is created using ruby on rails, mainly because i want to learn ruby on rails development.

A better choice of technology would be Angular and Firebase due to the realtime nature of the project.
